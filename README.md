# tree-visualisation-and-algorithms
Trees are a fundamental concept in computer science, crucial for building complex software systems. Despite the existence of tree visualisation tools, few provide interactive learning. This project aims to bridge this gap by offering an educational tool that facilitates hands-on understanding of tree data structures.

## Key Features

- Visualise various tree operations (insert and delete) and algorithms (search and traversal) on Binary, N-ary, Binary Search and AVL Trees.
- Alter speed of visualisations
- Walk through each individual step for visualisations
- Save your favorite trees
- Test your comprehension through interactive exercises by selecting the correct node path for all operations and algorithms.
- Targeted for educational environments to aid learning.
- Tested rigorously via integration, unit and manual testing.


## Evaluation and Future Improvements

The application has been thoroughly evaluated to ensure its educational effectiveness. Suggestions for improvements are welcomed to further enhance the learning experience.
